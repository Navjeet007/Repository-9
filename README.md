Modify class Time2 of Fig. 8.5 to include a tick method that increments the time stored in a Time2 object by one second. Provide method incrementMinute to increment the minute by one and method incrementHour to increment the hour by one. The Time2 object should always remain in a consistent state. Write a program that tests the tick method, the incrementMinute method and the incrementHour method to ensure that they work correctly. Be sure to test the following cases: a) incrementing into the next minute, b) incrementing into the next hour and c) incrementing into the next day (i.e., 11:59:59 PM to 12:00:00 AM).
